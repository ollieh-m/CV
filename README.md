## Ollie Haydon-Mulligan

**Diligent problem-solving enthusiast, pushing myself every day to learn and improve.**

After five years organising national and local elections across the South West, I hung up my campaigning boots, got addicted to Codewars, and threw myself into the 16-week intensive **Makers Academy** bootcamp, which I finished in July.

Working on elections, I got huge satisfaction working out how to get what I needed from the tools available to me, but I was always frustrated by the limits of what I understood about how those tools worked. Learning to code has been like lifting a veil on the world around me – it’s an amazing feeling, and addictive, and I’m now massively excited to be seeking my first job as a Junior Developer, so I can on learning by throwing myself into new challenges.

Until Christmas 2015, I hadn’t written a line of code in any language. More than anything else at Makers, I learnt how to learn quickly and independently.
-	I learnt enough Javascript in two weeks to create a news-feed web app in Angular in two days
-	no-one in our final project team knew any Swift before we started creating our picture-messaging iPhone app
-	I built a Rails Instagram Clone in in three days after a week learning Ruby on Rails

##<a name="Teamplayer">Team player…</a>

Before joining Makers Academy, my job was to build and organise volunteer campaign teams, manage internal disputes and discplinary issues, and develop comprehensive campaign plans working with MPs, Parliamentary candidates, councillors, local Labour Party officers and Labour Party staff. 

So I am used to working in teams, and I love it – learning from each other, supporting each other, and achieving more than you could even imagine on your own.

At Makers Academy, I learnt to collaborate on code.
-	all coding Monday to Friday was pair-programming
-	daily standups, weekly retros and regular code reviews
-	on three projects, we worked in small teams using a fully agile development process

I developed the long-term 2015 General Election campaign plans for four priority seats in the South West.

I managed the General Election print scheme across the region, overseeing the planning and production of print for 52 constituencies.

I led the organisation of Labour Party election campaigns – including responsibility for campaign strategy, message, visits and events, print, voter contact on the doors and phones, and volunteer management – in Plymouth (2010 General Election), Brent and Harrow (2012 London Mayoral election), Bristol (2012 Bristol Mayoral election and 2013 local government elections), and Kingswood (2014 European Parliament election and 2015 General Election).

##Other

I write songs on the guitar occassionally, and play drums in two covers bands. I meditate by practicing paraddidles and double-stroke rolls to a metronome. 

I have a puppy whippet called Mabel who's started track racing. I run a bit as well. But I can't keep up.
