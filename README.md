## Ollie Haydon-Mulligan

Diligent problem-solving enthusiast, pushing myself every day to learn and improve.

After five years organising national and local elections across the South West, I hung up my campaigning boots and threw myself into the 16-week intensive Makers Academy bootcamp.
I completed the course in July, and am now very excited to be seeking my first job as a Junior Developer.

## Fast-learner…

Until Christmas 2015, I hadn’t written a line of code in any language. More than anything else at Makers, I learnt how to learn quickly and independently.
-	I learnt enough Javascript in two weeks to create a news-feed web app in Angular in two days
-	no-one in our final project team knew any Swift before we started creating our picture-messaging iPhone app
-	I built a Rails Instagram Clone in in three days after a week learning Ruby on Rails

##Team-player… 

Before joining Makers Academy, my job was to build and organise campaign teams and develop campaign plans with candidates and Party officers. 

I’m used to working in teams, and I love it – learning from each other, supporting each other, and achieving more than you could even imagine achieving on your own.

At Makers Academy, I learnt to collaborate on code.
-	all coding Monday to Friday was pair-programming
-	daily standups, weekly retros and regular code reviews
-	on three projects, we worked in small teams using a fully agile development process
